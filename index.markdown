I am a first year **PhD Student** with 
[Northeastern's PRL](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/) advised by 
[Steven Holtzen](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/sholtzen/).
I am broadly interested in type-and-effect systems and program logics
and their ability to provide correctness guarantees about interesting
computational systems. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science
at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in May 2024.
